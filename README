This cppdevtk toolkit is a great way for you, developers to simplify your C++ project with some prefabricated building blocks
so you do not need to reinvent the wheel every time you start a project.
We thought to share this cppdevtk in open source format, as a way to give back time to others who are sharing their open source projects
helping us and others to make great applications rather than spending time with “reinventing the wheel” for each project. 
Feel free to leave some feedback and comment on Github
